                            Circle K International (CKI) is a service organization that is centered around children. 
                            The three tenets of CKI are Leadership, Fellowship and service. CKI gives youths the opportunity to participate in projects
                            that render unselfish service. During my time as a CKI member, I have held the position of Chairperson for the Kiwanis Relations
                            Committee 2021-2022 and I am currently the 1st VP of the UWI MONA CKI 2022-2023. I am responsible for overseeing all the
                            committees that are in effect for the current CKI year. There are 5 committess namely: Kiwanis Family Relations, Service,
                            Programmes, Membership Development and Edcuation and Fundraising.

                        I have travelled acrosss the stars and galaxies to reside in your warm embrace.
                        Don't you believe that life has many gifts to offer? It is our responsibility to ensure
                        that whatever we take on, we do it to the best of our abilities. There are many children 
                        who wished they could have an oopotunity like ours. Attending school is a right that
                        many people have abused. Being educated comes with a lot of struggle because you might
                        not be able to do what you love because of a lack of opportunity. However, the converse
                        of having a good education is like hell on earth. Crime has certainly hindered our progress
                        as a nation. Our young men are dying and it pains my heart. The youths have to find a way,
                        to put the nine away, peace and love finally!!

                        I really enjoy the company of my freinds, Football and Video Games. My two favorite teams are 
                        FC Bayern Munich and FC Barcelona. I also have a love for the field of construction. It is my 
                        dream to be a football player for Barcelona.
